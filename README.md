# Map Reduce implemation in Dart.

 Most of it is borrowed from 'https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-mr.html'


>Your job is to implement a distributed MapReduce, consisting of two programs, the coordinator and the worker. There will be just one coordinator process, and one or more worker processes executing in parallel. In a real system the workers would run on a bunch of different machines, but for this lab you'll run them all on a single machine. The workers will talk to the coordinator via RPC. Each worker process will ask the coordinator for a task, read the task's input from one or more files, execute the task, and write the task's output to one or more files. The coordinator should notice if a worker hasn't completed its task in a reasonable amount of time (for this lab, use ten seconds), and give the same task to a different worker.
